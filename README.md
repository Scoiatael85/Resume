# Online Resume
_Get a programing job via programing_

This is a resume of my skills, references, etc thrown together on a website to be easily accesable to potential employers.

### Internationalize:
If you click directly on my name, you'll see it internationalize for you.

### Where it stands:
This currently is designed to have a bit of a video game feel/look. In the future this will evolve into a greater project.

## Setup - Installation
For the game to function correctly, you need to have a directory containing:
1. index.html
2. 'css' folder
  * style.css
  * bootstrap.css
  * bootstrap.min.css
3. 'js' folder
  * helper.js
  * jQuery.js
  * resumeBuilder.js
4. 'images' folder
  * Publication1.jpg
  * city.png
  * meta-tags.jpg
  * cloud.jpg
  * Me.png
  * phone.png
  * honeycombfav.jpg
  * bg.png
  * bg-top.png
  * bg-bottom.png
5.  README.md

If these items are not arrainged correctly, or any part of their names (including caps-vs-lowercase),
the resources.js and engine.js will not find them.

## Known bugs
Currently I'm not worrying about how pretty it is from a mobile device. That'll matter for an actual job, but for now I'm just trying to pass the class....

## Future projects
First and foremost is to make the colors/sizes/styles of the text look great. 
Secondly, I want to finish what I started with the mobile style. It is currently broken since I added the map and made my skill-boxes with loops.
Thirdly, I want to add a second and third version on the css style. I would like to have the viewer simply click a button (currently name 'not-yet') and have that completely change the look of the webiste.
